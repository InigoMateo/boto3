Sub-resources:

Sub-resources are methods that create a new instance of a child resource. This resourceâ€™s identifiers get passed along 
to the child. Bucket and Object are sub-resources of one another. 

If you have a bucket variable created you can create an object directly.

And if you have an Object variable, then you can get its bucket
