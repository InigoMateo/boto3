Uploading a File:

There are three ways you can upload a file:

    From an Object instance
    From a Bucket instance
    From the client

In each case, you have to provide the Filename, which is the path of the file you want to upload. Youâ€™ll now explore 
the three alternatives. Feel free to pick whichever you like most to upload the first_file_name to S3.

    ** You also may come with a question? Can i create "folders" inside a bucket in S3, yes you can. **

When defining the object you can indicate in the file name the path you want to create and the object to be store in.
so for instance a good file path would be:

s3_resource.Object(first_bucket_name, doc/textFile/first_file_name).upload_file(Filename=first_file_name)

S3 is going to build a path inside the bucket doc/textFile/... But Remember this! In aws s3 the concept of folder does
not exist only buckets and objects.
