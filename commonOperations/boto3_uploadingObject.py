Uploading a File:

There are three ways you can upload a file:

    From an Object instance
    From a Bucket instance
    From the client

In each case, you have to provide the Filename, which is the path of the file you want to upload. Youâ€™ll now explore 
the three alternatives. Feel free to pick whichever you like most to upload the first_file_name to S3.
